          <h1>Hi! I’m James Poetzscher.</h1>

          <p>
            I recently graduated from Stanford (’25), where I spent most of my time
            thinking about AI and doing math/cs.
          </p>


          <p>
            I’m a big superintelligence believer; I’m confident it’s the most powerful
            but also the most high variance thing that we (humans) will ever build.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t believe digital superintelligence will be conscious. I don’t believe
            consciousness and intelligence are especially related.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think mainstream SV thinking on who benefits from superintelligence is
            mostly inverted.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy thinking about philosophy. I’m a moral arealist who nevertheless
            spends lots of time thinking about what the ideal moral philosophy/system
            looks like.
          </p>

          <p>I think most people are macro-silly, micro-serious; they should be the opposite.</p>

          <p>I make very good chocolate chip cookies.</p>

          <p>Growing up, I lived in both SF and Singapore. I'm currently living in SF</p>

            <h4>Favorite Olympiad Problems</h4>
            <p>
              Recently, I’ve become interested in olympiad combinatorics problems
              (although I also enjoy the occasional number theory problem).
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve listed some of my favorite problems I’ve solved at various difficulty
              levels below (accompanied by their <a class="solid" href="https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/MOHS-hardness.pdf" target="_blank">MOHS</a>, as determined by Evan Chen).
              Yes… they’re all combo.

                  Calvin and Hobbes play a game. First, Hobbes picks a family $F$ of subsets of $\{1, 2, ..., 2020\}$, known to both players. Then, Calvin and Hobbes take turns choosing a number from $\{1, 2, ..., 2020\}$ which is not already chosen, with Calvin going first, until all numbers are taken (i.e., each player has $1010$ numbers). Calvin wins if he has chosen all the elements of some member of $F$, otherwise Hobbes wins. What is the largest possible size of a family $F$ that Hobbes could pick while still having a winning strategy?

                  Two squirrels, Bushy and Jumpy, have collected 2021 walnuts for the winter. Jumpy numbers the walnuts from 1 through 2021, and digs 2021 little holes in a circular pattern in the ground around their favourite tree. The next morning Jumpy notices that Bushy had placed one walnut into each hole, but had paid no attention to the numbering. Unhappy, Jumpy decides to reorder the walnuts by performing a sequence of 2021 moves. In the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps the positions of the two walnuts adjacent to walnut $k$.
                  Prove that there exists a value of $k$ such that, on the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps some walnuts $a$ and $b$ such that $a < k < b$.
