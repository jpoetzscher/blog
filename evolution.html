            <p>
              A couple years ago I saw a video on Twitter where a woman was talking about how, to her shock, she just learned that babies, 
              specifically babies under 6 months old, are not supposed to drink water. I, and many in the comment section, also did not know 
              this until watching the video. I then went down a rabbit hole, finding Reddit threads about grandparents insisting that we actually 
              should give babies water and about how this used to be commonplace.
            </p>

            <p>
              I thought something about this was very strange. It seemed almost like an evolutionary mistake that people would not (or at least appeared not to) 
              have the instinctual wiring to only give babies milk, given the potentially fatal consequences of giving them anything else. 
              And, given it is not just humans whose babies cannot drink water but all mammals, certainly these non-human mammals must have 
              this information hard-wired in; perhaps even two forms of wiring: on the parent side, the instinctual drive to only give babies milk, 
              and on the baby side, the instinctual desire to only consume milk. Most mammals do not have the necessary pattern-matching ability 
              to recognize (from a sparse set of examples) the benefits of giving babies milk, and the harms of giving them anything else. 
              And, even if certain mammals did have pattern-matching this powerful, without the ability to culturally transmit knowledge through generations, 
              each new generation would need to learn this for themselves, resulting in lots of unnecessary baby deaths as training data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Clearly, the solution in non-human mammals is hard-wiring. Looking at humans, though, this hard-wiring seems to have weakened. 
              Based on the Twitter and Reddit reactions (which extended to current parents who had given their kids water, so the argument 
              that the hard-wiring still exists but kicks in upon becoming a parent feels weak), it seems like some people lack the strong hard-wiring 
              to only feed babies milk. And I think there are other plausible examples of some humans lacking a specific piece of hard-wiring 
              that all other mammals have, and need to have, to survive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Consider whether a modern human dropped into their ancestral environment would have the same knowledge of what food is edible 
              and what food is not compared to a non-human mammal or even one of our many hominid ancestors (where we drop both into their 
              environment but without their parents or other animals of their species to learn behavior from; admittedly this is a difficult experiment to imagine).
              I have no strong evidence, but my suspicion is that modern humans would have less food knowledge than our hominid ancestors 
              given it is simply not a trait we need; culture has likely handled the transmission of knowledge about what food is safe to eat for 
              at least the last 10,000 years and possibly the last ~70,000 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              It seems quite likely to me that at some point, either humans or our recent hominid ancestors (within the last 1M years, probably), 
              became aware of various knowledge conducive to survival, through observation paired with newly evolved pattern matching, 
              and began to transmit this knowledge culturally through generations using language or proto-language skills. 
              This likely would have been the first time that a species became aware of, and capable of expressing, survival knowledge or instincts
              that had previously been transmitted through genetic hard-wiring. Eventually, cultural knowledge transmission became sufficient 
              to instill certain bits of survival knowledge without the aid of genetic hard-wiring. This probably happened much more recently, 
              likely within the last ~70,000 years after the cognitive revolution.
            </p>

            <p>
              As mutations occurred causing the omission of various pieces of survival-knowledge hard-wiring, in cases where this knowledge 
              was being actively transmitted through language across an entire population, those mutations likely would not be selected against.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: this is a different claim from two others that sound similar. First, the claim that cultural or societal changes have shifted our 
              environment and therefore the traits corresponding to high reproductive success today are different than those that conferred fitness 
              in our ancestral environment. Second, the claim that technological changes have allowed the success of people with traits that were 
              evolutionarily detrimental and may therefore relax selection pressure against those traits (for example, glasses reducing selection 
              pressure against poor eyesight). I agree with both claims. But I think this claim is slightly different and seemingly less well understood.
            </p>

            <p>
              In both cases, selection pressure against a type of trait seems to have been reduced due to a technology: culture in the former case 
              (for mental hard-wired survival knowledge), scientific technology such as glasses and C-sections in the latter case (for physical traits). 
              Observing physical traits is easier and therefore better researched than observing mental hard-wiring changes. 
              There is some evidence that physical traits historically selected against are reappearing due to relaxed selection pressure; for example, 
              <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6712615/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence</a> that female pelvis sizes 
              may be decreasing due to C-sections reducing selection pressure against narrow pelvises:
            </p>

            <p>
              It is not clear whether the hard-wiring of survival knowledge is decreasing, and there has seemingly been little research on it. Still, I think it is plausible, likely driven by culture taking over more of the burden of survival-knowledge transmission. If so, evolution may be offloading part of the burden of knowledge instillation onto culture.
            </p>

            <p>
              If this process is indeed occurring, it is interesting to ask what other mental hard-wiring we might lose over the next few millennia.
